This work has demonstrated mocaml, a small multi-level extension to OCaml for writing program generators. In mocaml, expressions can be dynamic until a certain stage has been reach, and afterwords the expression becomes static and it can be partially evaluated. A call unfolding strategy was also presented. It guarantees that recursive calls are only unfolded if there is a guarantee that
