\section{Generating Extensions and Program Generators}

In \cite{multilevel} the process of multi-level generating extensions is demonstrated. This will quickly be summarized as to later how handwriting program generators in mocaml differs from PE. For a program \texttt{p} written in language \texttt{L} then let $\llbracket \mathtt{p}\rrbracket_\mathtt{L}~\mathtt{in}$ denote the application of \texttt{L} program \texttt{p} to its input \texttt{in}. The process of multi-level generating extensions for an \texttt{n}-inpit
source program \texttt{p} is:

\begin{align*}
  \left. 
  \begin{aligned}
    \noalign{\vspace{-\baselineskip}}
    \mathtt{p-mgen}_0 &= \llbracket \mathtt{mcogen}\rrbracket_\mathtt{L} \mathtt{p} ~ '0...n-1'\\  
    \mathtt{p-mgen}_1 &= \llbracket \mathtt{p-mgen}_0\rrbracket_\mathtt{L} \mathtt{in}_0\\
                      &\vdots\\
    \mathtt{p-res}_1 &= \llbracket \mathtt{p-mgen}_{n-2}\rrbracket_\mathtt{L} \mathtt{in}_{n-2}\\
    \mathtt{p-res}_1 &= \llbracket \mathtt{p-mgen}_{n-2}\rrbracket_\mathtt{L} \mathtt{in}_{n-2}\\
    \mathtt{out}_1 &= \llbracket \mathtt{p-res}_{n-1}\rrbracket_\mathtt{L} \mathtt{in}_{n-1}
  \end{aligned}
  \right\}n~\text{stages}                     
\end{align*}

The multilevel program generator \texttt{mcogen}\footnote{The program generator is also for historical reasons called a compiler generator, hence the \texttt{cogen} name. This is because \texttt{p} would be an interpreter.} is first specialized w.r.t. the \texttt{L} program \texttt{p} and a multi-level annotation of the inputs with binding time (bt) classification $t_0,..,t_{n-1}$ to produce a multi-level \textit{generating extension} $\text{p-mgen}_0$. The generating extension is then specialized in $n$ stages with an input and each staging produces a new generating extension until a final output is produced.

Program generation and specialization in mocaml is slightly different from the traditional generating extensions in partial evaluation. mocaml is used to handwrite OCaml program generators and the user must manually annotate the multi-level program with binding time information to stage the program. This is in contrast to BTA which, as it was noted in \cite{metaML}, can be seen as an automatic staging technique. Manual annotation might in some situation be preferred since the evaluation order can be controlled \cite{metaML}. Next, the user must invoke a special \texttt{run} operation that takes a multilevel $n$ input mocaml program \texttt{p} and an input $\mathtt{in}_i$. As a result, a new annotated multilevel program is produced that might be specialized again with the remaining inputs. Without going into the details of mocaml, writing program generators looks as follows:

\begin{align*}
&\text{\texttt{let res1 = run p in}}_0\\
&\text{\texttt{let res2 = run res1 in}}_1\\
&...\\
&\text{\texttt{let out = run res$_{n-1}$ in$_{n-1}$}}
\end{align*}

This looks similar to the multi-level specialization with multi-level generating extensions. Again, to summarize the difference, the annotations are done manually and the output of each stage is a residual multi-level program that can be specialized further. Hand writing different program generators then depends on how the \texttt{run} operation is used and with different inputs. Multi-level PE would on the other hand produce a multi-level generating extension at each stage. Additionally, in mocaml the output of any of the $n$ is a multi-level residual program which also be run since it is just a generated program.
